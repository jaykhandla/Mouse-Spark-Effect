## Overview

This project demonstrates an interactive spark effect using JavaScript and CSS. Upon clicking anywhere on the page, spark animations are triggered at the mouse position. The spark effect is generated dynamically, with multiple spark elements radiating outward in different directions, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Spark Effect**: Sparks are generated in real-time when the user clicks on the screen.
- **CSS Animation**: Spark elements are animated using CSS keyframes for smooth visual effects.
- **Customizable**: The spark effect can be customized in terms of color, size, and animation duration by modifying the relevant CSS properties.
- **Mouse-Triggered**: The sparks appear at the location where the user clicks, making the experience interactive and engaging.

## Installation

To use this effect on your own webpage, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the effect in action.

Alternatively, you can copy the code directly into your HTML and CSS files and integrate the spark effect into your own project.

## Usage

Click anywhere on the screen to trigger the spark animation. Each click will create a set of sparks at the location of the click. The sparks will animate outward from the click point.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and creating the spark animations.
- **JavaScript**: For capturing mouse click events and dynamically creating the spark elements.
